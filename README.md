# EDA and Machine Learning Projects

This repository features exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning projects executed in Jupyter Notebook using public datasets from Kaggle.

## Overview

- Utilized **pandas**, **numpy**, **scikit-learn**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib** libraries within Jupyter Notebook, leveraging Kaggle datasets for comprehensive data analysis and machine learning workflows.

## Projects

### 1. House Price Prediction

- Conducted exploratory data analysis and built machine learning models to predict house prices using key real estate features and market trends.

### 2. Iris Flower Species Prediction

- Performed data preprocessing, visualization, and classification modeling on the Iris dataset to accurately predict iris flower species based on morphological characteristics.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eda-ml-projects.git
   cd eda-ml-projects
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib jupyter
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open and Explore**
   Open the respective notebooks to explore code, analysis, and visualizations.

## Datasets
